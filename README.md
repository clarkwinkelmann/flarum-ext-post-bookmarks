This extension lets user bookmark posts.

Bookmarked posts appear under the additional bookmarks page.

In this initial version there is no option to sort bookmarked posts or group them by discussion.
They are sorted by creation date.

## Installation

    composer require clarkwinkelmann/flarum-ext-post-bookmarks

## Support

This extension is under **minimal maintenance**.

It was developed for a client and released as open-source for the benefit of the community.
I might publish simple bugfixes or compatibility updates for free.

You can [contact me](https://clarkwinkelmann.com/flarum) to sponsor additional features or updates.

Support is offered on a "best effort" basis through the Flarum community thread.
